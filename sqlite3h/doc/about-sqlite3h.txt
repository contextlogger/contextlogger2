This is a modified version of SQLite 3.6.5. It has been tweaked to
compile for both Symbian and Linux, and makefiles for Symbian have
been added.

We are using a separate name to avoid conflicts with mainline versions
of SQLite and Symbian's own SQLite port. The "h" stands for HIIT. The
modifications made to SQLite are provided under the same license as
SQLite 3.6.5 itself. See http://www.sqlite.org/ for more information.

The Symbian port supports S60 v3.0-up, and requires the P.I.P.S.
library. The Symbian builds supports neither file locking nor thread
safety.

Symbian v9.4-up has the SQLite3-based Symbian SQL engine built-in, and
using that instead when available is recommended for decreased
application size and memory consumption.

The Symbian port is presently intended for linking as a static
library. Building as a DLL is problematic, since the library contains
static writable data, and building a DLL with the GCCE version
currently included in Symbian SDKs produces a broken binary, which
cannot be installed and/or linked. The workaround is to use the
expensive, commercial ARM compiler, or to use a more recent version of
GCCE and to modify Symbian header files enough to fix the
header/compiler incompatibilities. Note, however, that this port is
missing many of the required IMPORT_C and EXPORT_C directives.

A more practical workaround for most is to link this library
statically to the program binary. See the STATICLIBRARY directive for
MMP files.
