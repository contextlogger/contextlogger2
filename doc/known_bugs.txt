ContextLogger2 Known Defects

- The **Symbian client/server** interface is not fully implemented, making it presently impossible to receive the result when evaluating a Lua expression that produces a long (textual) result. This is not difficult to implement, but as of yet we have not had the need to implement the full interface.

- One problem with our use of GLib is that the **GError** API is incompatible with reporting **out-of-memory** errors, as reporting an error always involves GError object allocation. This issue only concerns Symbian, where GLib does not abort on out-of-memory errors. We have only started to change our code to consider the NULL GError value as indicating an OOM error. We must also implement our own alternatives for some of the GLib functions, since Nokia's port does not gracefully deal with OOM errors, say g_error_new will likely internally cause a KERN-EXEC 3 in the event it fails to allocate a GError.

- **GLib-based memory allocations** need more comprehensive checking for success on Symbian (not that the Nokia guys seem to be doing much of that within their GLib port). We may for instance add appropriate macro invocations to ensure predictable behavior in out-of-memory situations; http://library.forum.nokia.com/index.jsp?topic=/S60_5th_Edition_Cpp_Developers_Library/GUID-FE27AB35-C6FD-4F11-802D-0D5FCFFC2976/html/mrt/s60_openc_using_glib8.html

- To avoid a possible **Jaiku conflict**, we should give a different UID3 to the keyevents DLLs. This will also give them a different name. Another alternative would be to use the same vendor name (i.e., "Jaiku"), but there might be questions about whether that is appropriate, especially if we ended up making changes to the libraries.
