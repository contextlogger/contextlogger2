// The class CKeyEventsAnim is the key event listener.
// It gets all raw input events from the window server and
// updates an RProperty whenever it sees a keydown event.
// It is instantiated from CKeyEventsServerDll::CreateInstanceL
// when client side code calls RAnim::Construct.
//
// Although the class is an animation class, it doesn't ever draw
// anything or take any commands (as would normally be the case
// for an animation dll). It does take initialization
// parameters in the form of a TKeyServerArgs struct pointer
// passed to RAnim::Construct, which specifies the property
// category and name to update. The category and key need to
// be passed to this class so that they can be defined in
// a process with a suitable SecureUID (you can only define
// new keys with category==process's SecureUID on v9, this
// dll gets loaded into the window server, and it owns the
// namespace, we can't guarantee we wouldn't clash).
//
// To share efficiently over multiple clients the best way is
// to build a separate client-server layer on top of the keyevents
// client dll, since that would allow for sharing a single instance
// over multiple client processes.
//
// Should you want to extent the functionality, you can either
// pass more args to Construct by extending TKeyServerArgs, or
// by starting to define commands. E.g., getting it to listen
// to specific keypresses could be done as new flags in Construct+
// additional RProperty keys to update.
//
// We use an RProperty instead of an asynchronous command so
// that potentially several interested clients can get
// notifications without having to have more than one instance
// listening to key events, as it inserts code into any input
// event codepath. This is slightly broken though, as the
// different clients will need to collaborate on getting an
// instance running and the category+key to use.
//
// TODO(mikie): if we want to listen to several different events
// in the future, using separate async commands for those would
// probably make more sense than several properties.
