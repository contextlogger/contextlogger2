ABOUT

This is Miso Build Tool, aka Sake. It builds on Rake (Ruby Make) for
Rake-like functionality, and provides libraries for managing PyS60
native extension projects.

PREREQUISITES

This tool has been tested with Ruby 1.8.2 only, on Linux and
Windows/Cygwin. It has dependencies to certain command line tools
commonly found in Unix-like environments. For building PyS60
extensions, a compatible Symbian SDK setup is required. The tool
probably still makes too many assumptions about the Symbian build
environment used, but hopefully these will eventually get removed, or
at least documented.

Any required third-party Ruby libraries are included in the "lib"
directory, for convenience. Libraries modified from the original have
been given a different name.

INSTALLATION

If you have Sake installed already, type

  sake install

Otherwise type

  ruby bootstrap.rb

The installation is only for the user, and assumes that a directory
called ~/bin exists, and is on the executable search PATH.
