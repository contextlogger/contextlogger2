This iksemel Symbian port is not JUST a Symbian port. For one thing,
it strives to retain compatibility with other platforms.

Also, this port defines new transport implementations, one implemented
in Symbian C++, and one based on POSIX and libev.

The port also includes a new stream API for asynchronous streaming,
connects, reads, writes, the works, all driven asynchronously. The key
here is that we want the stream of ``iksStreamHook`` invocations to
come in without blocking the thread. The stream API is somewhat
different from the original, and most names have been changed to avoid
confusion, but the API is close to the original in spirit.

Our port is based on a recent mainline snapshot of iksemel, which
appeared to have improved support for asynchrony, and we did want to
drive iksemel asynchronously both on Symbian and Linux.

The modifications are licensed under the LGPL 2.1 license, as is the
case with the original code. In addition, the ikst_* and socketaos.*
source files are also dual licensed under the MIT license.

The documentation has not been updated to reflect the modifications to
the original.
