DISCOVERED ISSUES AND FIXES FOR CONTEXTLOGGER2

- PROBLEM: On Symbian, QXmpp appears to attempt to make an internet
  connection somewhere already before we request a connection to the
  Jabber server. Or at least require an access point, possibly asking
  for one interactively. This is not acceptable in the ContextLogger2
  daemon.

  FIX: This appears to happen as upon QXmppClient initialization a lot
  of subobjects are instantiated, and one of these, namely
  QXmppTransferManager, has a QTcpServer in its property. This likely
  requires an internet interface to listen to, hence the IAP
  requirement. As CL2 doesn't actually require transfer functionality,
  we addressed this issue simply by not instantiating
  QXmppTransferManager at all.

  UPDATE: A later upstream update has fixed this issue by not
  instantiating QXmppTransferManager by default.
